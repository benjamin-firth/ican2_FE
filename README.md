### ABOUT
This app connects users who are looking for a mentee/mentor relationship. Users can create a profile, search through all mentors (with filters), and message each other.

For this application, we built the backend and frontend from scratch. The frontend was built with React Hooks, Redux, graphQL, and Sass. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project has a robust testing suite.
